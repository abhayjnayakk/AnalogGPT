# Future Work

| Area | Planned Work |
|------|--------------|
| Cloud | GPU-enabled FastAPI; autoscale RL workers via Ray |
| LLM Fine-tune | Continue-pretraining on 500k proprietary schematics; LoRA-style adapters |
| Reward Modeling | Diff-Sim: differentiable SPICE surrogate for gradient-based reward |
| HW Acceleration | Compile SPICE kernels to CUDA for 20Ã— speedup |
| Verification | Formal-methods integration for corner / Monte Carlo coverage |
